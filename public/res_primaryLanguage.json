      "description": "Odd Duck Product Co has tasked you with creating a web app to collect anonymous employee votes on three potential products. The app should display the images side-by-side, store each vote, calculate totals, and display results visually once 25 selections have been made. You will need to use Javascript, CSS, and JSON to manage the size and aspect ratio of the images, store the votes, and display the results with custom fonts, colors, and semantic HTML layout. In addition to tracking the total number of clicks, the marketing team is interested in the percentage of times each image is clicked when displayed. This means you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is shown and do the necessary calculations to display the percentage results. Your final app should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and accurately reflect the employee votes while maintaining the integrity of the selection process.",

Specifically, Pat needs a proof of concept application to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day based on factors such as the minimum and maximum number of customers per hour, and the average number of cookies purchased per customer. You will need to create a Sales Data page (sales.html) where you will use separate JS object literals for each shop location to generate sales data and display the results in the browser. You will also need to create a public-facing homepage (index.html) that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, and informative. In addition, you will need to design the documents, color scheme, fonts, and any additional images for the public-facing site using a logo image provided by Pat.",

      "description": "We developed a fully immersive clue-based murder mystery game that will provide the user with an exciting and engaging experience. The game will feature multiple rooms, each with their own unique background story and clues, where the user will have to determine who the killer is, what weapon was used, and how the victim was murdered. To create a truly immersive experience, we will be including sound and an animated entrance screen that features a card flip animation. The sound effects will be tailored to the game and will enhance the overall experience, providing users with an immersive and engaging environment. The entrance screen will create a sense of anticipation and excitement for the user, setting the tone for the rest of the game. In addition, the game will include a drop-down menu that generates a random killer, making each playthrough unique. This will add an element of surprise and challenge to the game, keeping users engaged and interested. Overall, the combination of interactive elements, sound effects, and a dynamic storyline will create a truly engaging and immersive experience for the user.",
